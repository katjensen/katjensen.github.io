Hello! Welcome to my personal page. I enjoy wearing many hats as a remote sensing scientist, machine learning engineer, Earth science educator, and mapping enthusiast. 

I was born and raised in Honolulu Hawai'i, where I grew up with a deep respect for our natural resources and a love for the outdoors that drove me to pursue a PhD in Earth & Environmental Sciences. I am a seasoned geospatial and machine learning Python developer, and the occasional baker.

I am currently working as a data scientist at [Capella Space](https://www.capellaspace.com/) developing environmental monitoring analytics from X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). My previous works include:

* Developing machine learning and computer vision algorithms for agricultural monitoring and mapping of regenerative practices at [Indigo Ag](https://www.indigoag.com/)
* PhD research on regional to global scale mapping of surface water patterns and wetlands classification using a variety of different satellite and aerial remote sensing data, at the City College of New York and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)
* Flood risk assessments and supply deployment recommendations at the Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Centre
* Assimilating regional weather forecasts and crop yield models at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) at Columbia University
