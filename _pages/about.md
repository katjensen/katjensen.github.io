Hello! Welcome to my personal page. I enjoy wearing many hats as a remote sensing scientist, machine learning engineer, Earth science educator, and mapping enthusiast. 

I am a data scientist at **[Capella Space](https://www.capellaspace.com/)** developing environmental monitoring analytics from X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). In previous roles, I've worked on:

* Developing machine learning and computer vision algorithms for agricultural monitoring and mapping of regenerative practices at **[Indigo Ag](https://www.indigoag.com/)**
* Regional to global scale mapping of surface water patterns and wetlands classification using a variety of different satellite and aerial remote sensing data, at the **City College of New York** and **NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)**
* Flood risk assessments and supply deployment recommendations at the **Red Cross/Red Crescent Climate Centre**
* Assimilating regional weather forecasts and crop yield models at the **International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI)** at Columbia University
