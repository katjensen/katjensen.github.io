excerpt: 'How can environmental data help predict malaria risk ?'

In a project funded by NASA SERVIR (2013 - 2015) during my PhD program, we investigated the relationship between malaria occurrence and environmental conditions that could be monitored from space.

## Project Background:

Vector-borne diseases are driven by environmental conditions that harbor specific vector habitat conditions such as:

* specific air temperature
* humidity for adult mosquito survival
* surface water for reproduction

The impact of epidemics can be mitigated with prediction and timely deployment of appropriate vector control measures.

## Modelling Vectorial Capacity:

* Vectorial capacity (VCAP) is a measure that expresses malaria transmission risk (receptivity of an area to malaria)
* The first VCAP model developed by U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Columbia University was originally driven by satellite estimates of (1) precipitation and (2) land surface temperature
* This model was generally successful in predicting onset **timing** of seasonal infection spikes, but struggled with predicting **duration** and **intensity**
* Our project focused on improving upon this model by incorporating local estimates of surface water area fraction derived from satellite measurements

## Case Study: Relating Historical Surface Water and Malaria Occurrence in Eritrea, East Africa

**Spatial distribution** of mean surface water fraction and mean malaria incidence rate across subzones of Eritrea (excluding coastal zones), 1999-2003:
