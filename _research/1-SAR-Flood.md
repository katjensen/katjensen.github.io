Awareness of changing ground conditions is critical for effective disaster response, making satellite imagery an important source of this information today. At Capella Space, we are developing tools to help endusers task and interpret our SAR imagery quickly for flood mapping.

## What is SAR ?
Most people are familiar with optical satellite imagery (observed in the **visible** range of the electromagenetic spectrum). These kind of images are passively sensed, meaning that the sun acts as a light source, similar to a camera without flash.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a radar system that uses microwaves to create detailed images of the Earth's surface. It's called "synthetic aperture" because it uses advanced processing techniques to simulate a much larger antenna than what's actually physically possible.

SAR works by transmitting radio waves from a radar antenna on a platform (like a satellite or airplane) towards the ground. The waves reflect off of objects and return to the antenna, where they're recorded. By measuring the time it takes for the waves to travel and bounce back, SAR can determine the distance to the objects on the ground.

Active sensors like SAR can help deliver timely information day or night and through cloudy conditions. SAR is used for a wide variety of applications, from mapping and monitoring changes in the Earth's surface to tracking ships and detecting oil spills in the ocean.
