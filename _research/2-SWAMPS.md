The Surface Water Microwave Product Series (SWAMPS) is a gridded global surface water fraction product derived from combined passive-active microwave datasets (SSM/I, SSMIS, ERS, QuikSCAT, ASCAT). Its development was supported by the [NASA MEaSURES Program](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fearthdata.nasa.gov%2Fcommunity%2Fcommunity-data-system-programs%2Fmeasures-projects%2Fan-inundated-wetlands-esdr&sa=D)

SWAMPS was derived using a land cover-supported, atmospherically-corrected dynamic mixture model applied to 20+ years of combined, daily, passive/active microwave remote sensing data. Learn more

This data set has been used in projects looking at large scale inundation patterns and methane modeling in wetlands across the globe.
